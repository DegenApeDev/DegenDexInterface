[DegenDex](https://degendex.xyz) is an automated market maker (“**AMM**”) that allows two tokens to be exchanged on the [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain) (BSC). It is fast, cheap, and allows anyone to participate. 

We will be adding more chains shortly to allow Dogechain, Pulsechain and AVAX as well! 

This repo is responsible for the **exchange** interface of the AMM: [degendex.xyz](https://degendex.xyz)
